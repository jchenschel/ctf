# Introduction
This is a purposely vulnerable server ran by TryHackMe.  Upon reviewing the main website for this CTF we are given a link to a YouTube video.  This video is a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBSR3DyobIY). from the 1995 cyberpunk movie _Johnny Mnemonic_.  The goal of this CTF is to answer a myriad of questions from TryHackMe, and to locate and obtain the ```user.txt``` and ```root.txt```

----------------------------------------------

## Summation of path to ```root.txt```
Using `Nmap` it was discovered that the `Ubuntu Linux` server was running 3 services. Running on this server was a `vsFTPd `service on port 21 handling the File Transfer Protocol.  Additionally, there was an `Apache` server running on port 80 handling the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Lastly on port 1337, `OpenSSH` was running handling the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).  Checking against common vulnerability databases no services were known to be easily exploitable.

Enumerating the web service, we discovered a directory hidden from ```robots.txt```.  This prevents any search engine crawlers from caching that subdirectory.  The disallowed subdirectory was listed as `/webmasters/*`, which indicates that `/webmasters/` and any further subdirectories or files within that directory would be 'hidden'.  In addition to `/webmasters` we also discovered `/admin` and `/backups` from the `/webmasters` domain.  From `/backups` we find `backups.zip` .  

At this point we've cataloged the following websites/files;
* mnemonic.thm/
* mnemonic.thm/
* mnemonic.thm/webmasters
* mnemonic.thm/webmasters/admin
* mnemonic.thm/webmasters/backup
* mnemonic.thm/webmasters/backup/backup.zip

We obtain the file and verify that it is a `.zip` file and that it is password encrypted.  Utilizing `fcrackzip` we were able to decrypt the password.  After unzipping we find `note.txt` which gives us the FTP username ftpuser.

Using the FTP username I was able to brute-force the password using `hydra`.  From that user we find what appears to be a SSH key, `id_rsa`, also find what turns out to be the associated SSH user `james` from `not.txt`.

Pivoting to the SSH service, we attempted to login using the username `james` and the discovered `id_rsa` private key.  The key is password protected.  Using `johntheripper` we were able to crack the password.  After logging in successfully, after about a minute an IPS/IDS (Intrusion Prevention Systems / Intrusion Detection Systems) script shows us `Unauthorized access was detected`.  Shortly thereafter, we are given a countdown from 10 to 0 and are seemingly kicked out of the SSH session.

We reconnect to the SSH session using the verified credentials from earlier.  Working quickly, we do a system wide search for all files with SUID permissions.  We locate what appears to be 2 files with `base64` encrypted filenames and 2 `.txt` files.   The 2 `.txt` files, `6450.txt` and `noteforjames.txt`,  gave me another username 'condor'.   Additionally we are given information about an image based encryption method named Mnemonic.

[Mnemonic](https://github.com/MustafaTanguner/Mnemonic).  is a steganography tool developed by the CTF creator.  It requires 2 files to successfully decrypt, an image and an code which was given when encrypted.  The code turns out to be in `6450.txt`.  Each of the lines will be an ASCII character.  Which should make our encrypted ASCII 15 characters long.

When decrypted the `base64` filenames give a URL to an image.![[maxresdefault.jpg]]

Using `Mnemonic` we decrypt the previous image and get a password for condor.  Utilizing these credentials I log into an SSH session as condor.  We find that `condor` is able to utilize `/usr/bin/python3 /bin/examplecode.py` with `sudo`.

Inspection of `/bin/examplecode.py` reveals a Python program which appears to give basic system information and services.  Further we see we can exploit the script, by choosing option `0` followed by a `.` when prompted `yes/no`.  Will enable us to run binaries.

```python
if select == 0: 
    time.sleep(1)
        x = str(input("are you sure you want to quit ? yes : "))

if ex == ".":
   print(os.system(input("\nRunning....")))
if ex == "yes " or "y":
       sys.exit()
```

Utilizing this, I am able to run `/bin/bash` as `root`.  From here, I was able to capture the `root.txt`.  After encoding the flag into MD5 the CTF was complete.

----------------------------------------------

# Initial Enumeration
------------------------------------
## Nmap
* Port 21 (FTP) File Transfer Protocol is running vsftpd 3.0.3
* Port 80 (HTTP) Hyper Text Transfer Protocol running Apache 2.4.29
* Port 1337 (SSL) Secure Socket Layer running OpenSSH 7.6p1
* Machine appears to be am Ubuntu machine.

```bash
21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
1337/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1
```

----------------------------------------------
## No low-hanging exploit/vulnerability 
This was confirmed with ```searchsploit```.  Checked all services against it, and found no readily available PoC or exploit.

----------------------------------------
## FTP
### No anonymous login allowed.
```bash
ftp 10.10.6.176
Connected to 10.10.6.176.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.10.6.176:root): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
530 Login incorrect.
```
-----------------------------------------
## Webserver
### Nikto didn't find anything helpful
```bash
nikto -h 10.10.6.176 | tee ~/ctf/thm/mnemonic/nikto.log
- Nikto v2.1.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Target IP:          10.10.6.176
+ Target Hostname:    10.10.6.176
+ Target Port:        80
+ Start Time:         2021-03-23 19:47:45 (GMT0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
+ The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
+ The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. This header can hint to the user agent to protect against some forms of XSS
+ The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. This could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type
+ No CGI Directories found (use '-C all' to force check all possible dirs)
+ "robots.txt" contains 2 entries which should be manually viewed.
+ Apache/2.4.29 appears to be outdated (current is at least Apache/2.4.37). Apache 2.2.34 is the EOL for the 2.x branch.
+ Allowed HTTP Methods: POST, OPTIONS,sHEAD, GET 
+ OSVDB-3233: /icons/README: Apache default file found.
+ 7890 requests: 0 error(s) and 7 item(s) reported on remote host
+ End Time:           2021-03-23 20:15:42 (GMT0) (1677 seconds)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### robots.txt gave us target.com/webmasters/*
```bash
 cat robots.txt 
User-agent: *
Allow: / 
Disallow: /webmasters/*
```

### Initial Subdirectory Bruteforce

Found a few interesting  subdirectories to enumerate.  ```/admin``` ```/backups```.
```bash
 gobuster dir -u 10.10.6.176/webmasters/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,html,txt,pdf,zip -o gob_extensions.log
===============================================
/admin                (Status: 301) [Size: 321] [--> http://10.10.6.176/webmasters/admin/]
/backups              (Status: 301) [Size: 323] [--> http://10.10.6.176/webmasters/backups/]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]                                               
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]   
```
Checking ```/webmasters/admin``` for further subdirectories and files.  A login page which we could brute-force.
```bash
gobuster dir -u 10.10.6.176/webmasters/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,html,txt,pdf,zip -o webmasters_admin.log

/admin.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 948]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]  
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]  
/login.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 152]
```
Discovering more subdirectories and files from ```/webmasters/backups```.   We find ```backups.zip```.
```bash
gobuster dir -u 10.10.6.176/webmasters/backups/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,html,txt,pdf,zip -o webmasters_backups.log

/backups.zip          (Status: 200) [Size: 409]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]  
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
